/*--In order to write code that mimics a bowling game, let's start with the simplest concept.
A player rolls the ball!

For each "turn" in bowling, a player gets two rolls.

We'll cover two broad scenarios that could arise when a player rolls:

Player knocks down impressive pins (a spare or a strike)

Player knocks down 0 pins

Spare: when a player hits all the pins over the course of two rolls (one turn)

Strike: when a player hits all the pins in a single roll --*/
